# MIL_dataframework_v0
This is a naive framework for multi instance learning with images. The issue here si that you need a small model (resnet34
for instance) if you have less than 16/17 gb of VRAM (RAM'S GPU). \
Of course you can find a way to overcome this issue, if so, don't hesitate to raise an issue :)
